# deep-learning_first-neural-network

### Associated tasks

In this project, I have build a neural network from scratch to carry out a prediction problem on the "Bike-sharing rental process" dataset! I have used the basic deep learning concepts like gradient descent, backpropagation etc. The more detailed information about every step along with the code can be found in the "dlnd-your-first-neural-network.html" file. I will suggest to read this.

### Files

1. **dlnd-your-first-neural-network.ipynb** : This is the jupyter notebook file which is having all the executable code
2. **dlnd-your-first-neural-network.html** : This is the corresponding HTML file for the notebook
3. **environment.yaml** : This contains the information of all the necessary packages which i have used to create this project in conda environment. Use below command to create the same..
> use conda env create -f environment.yaml

4. **requiremets.txt** : This file can be used to install the necessary packages with pip. Follow below command: - 
> pip install -r requirements.txt

5. **Bike-Sharing-Dataset** : This directory is having the necessary dataset files in it which have been used for the purpose of this project
